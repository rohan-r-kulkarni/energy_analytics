# Environmental Impact and Industrial Revenue vs. Energy Generation
A Predictive Analytics Approach On Time Series

We investigate per capita energy generation, key environmental health factors (water quality, air quality, drought severity), and per capita revenue from electricity sales monthly time series data from 2001-2022 for certain states in the United States, attempting to illuminate how industrial patterns have affected economic development and/or disturbed local environments.
